# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This project uses bootstrap to style pages within the previously created portfolio.
I chose the wireframe task for the last project but decided to create a new porfolio from scratch for this to gain experience & used bootstap to style the appropriate elements.
This uses bootstrap stying in the  <div class="pl-5"> in the index page.
It uses .card-header for the contact page, etc.
It uses bootstrap positioning e.g. col-lg-4 col-6 for the portfilio page.
All pages have bootstap components.
